; It uses -n to suppress auto-print because we are controlling what to print.
; It uses the 1addr pattern space to print the name of the node.
; It uses the 2addr pattern space to select the region of allocated resources information, and print the allocated resources information only with another pattern space.
kubectl describe nodes | sed -n '/^Allocated /,/^Events:/ { /^  [^(]/ p; }; /^Name: / p'
