# -Es causes :print prints to stdout, instead of showing the output with the builtin pager.
# -u reverts the effect of -Es, because the presence of -Es implies user config is not loaded.
# :set nonumber turns off line number.
# :put =execute('highlight') puts the output of the Ex command into the buffer.
# :g/^$/d deletes any empty lines.
# :print finally prints to stdout.
