# Terminfo
#
# For some unknown reason, the builtin infocmp on macOS does not look at
# ~/.terminfo even TERMINFO is set.
# Therefore, it is necessary to install ncurses from Homebrew, and
# make it available in $PATH.
#
# And then we can either use the terminfo database that comes with ncurses, or
# install a new one at ~/.terminfo.
# To install a new one at ~/.terminfo, see :h terminfo in neovim.

# $TERM
#
# Program likes neovim has very strict requirement on the value being correct.
# iTerm2.app: $TERM=iterm2
# Terminal.app: $TERM=nsterm
# tmux: $TERM=tmux-256color

# Known issues
#
# Undercurl support is still missing with neovim + tmux + iTerm2.app.
# Undercurl is supported with neovim + iTerm2.app though.

# Alacritty
#
# The following have been tried:
# - Set $TERM to "alacritty-direct".
#   `pastel colorcheck` reports RGB has problem.
# - Modify terminfo.src and create "alacritty-fixed" which use=xterm+direct.
#   `pastel colorcheck` reports RGB has problem.
# - Set $TERM to "alacritty" or "alacritty-direct", and terminal-features ",$TERM:RGB".
#   This works.
# However, Alacritty does not scroll tmux window like iTerm2 does.

# Kitty
#
# The author of kitty thinks tmux is no good.
# (https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745)
# To me, tmux offers
# - Session restoration.
# - Multiple windows with keyboard shortcuts to navigate between them.
# - Splits in a window.
